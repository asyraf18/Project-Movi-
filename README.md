Introduction

For our project we have decided to develop a mobile application that will help people book their movie tickets according to their  time , date and choice. On start, the application will prompt the user to sign up and then login. After that there will be a display page like a gallery full of movie options to choose for the user. After the user finds his choice he can select the preferred day and time to watch the movie in the cinema theater he/she can pay for the ticket through paypal. Once the payment is received the application will produce a digital ticket that will expire after one use.

Problem description
Background of the problem

In recent days, movie theaters are a great resource for entertainment. Most of the people often like to enjoy a part of their holiday watching a movie in a theater with family or friends. But most of the time it is difficult for many people to physically go to the theater having much time in hand to book their preferred seats earlier. Thus who can not make it within the time often has to cancel their plan or sit in undesired seats.


Problem statement

Almost all the movie ticket booking applications nowadays provide a generic serial number for tickets. Which are needed to show on the counter of the cinema hall later. Our application will get people rid of this manual procedure of standing in line.

Project Objective

To solve the problems stated above, we are coming up with a mobile application named ‘Movi’. It is basically an online movie ticket booking application for mobile devices. People who are on the rush with their works during weekdays will be able to use it for searching their preferred movies and book the tickets earlier of the show time date.

Project Scope

Scope

Developing a interactive mobile application that will reduce the physical effort of people very easily. Movie lovers don’t have to wait long standing in lines no more. They can purchase their tickets directly from their smartphones by installing this app.
•	User has to sign up and login using their Gmail account in this app for their future preferences.
•	A home page containing the list of movies which can be scrolled.
•	After selecting a movie the app will prompt a window asking the user to select his/her preferred day and time for the show.
•	Before the final phase of booking the application will prompt a window asking the user to pay for the tickets through paypal.
•	The user needs to fill up the payment form with his/her credentials.
•	Once the payment is received, there will be a pop out window with a digital ticket with confirmation bar code for the booked tickets.
•	Once the QR code is scanned, the movie and seat details will appear on the screen and the QR code will expire.  



Targeted user

We are hoping that our app, Movi will be useful to people of all ages specially between 15-35 years old. Because these people are mostly students and service officers who don’t have enough extra time rather than their work during week days. So this application will help them the most to plan a perfect weekend without any inconvenience. 




Specific platform

We are developing this application using React-Native. It will be developed for Android mobile devices. We may also need to use Flash for a flash screen for the application.






Constraints

The most significant constraint for this project is time. We had to learn so many things in a short period of time and then apply them in real life. Developing a mobile application is really a time consuming process specially for beginners like us. There are so many things that are needed to built up from the scratch and for that we really need to have clear knowledge about every aspect of react-native.












Project Stages

 



Significance and Summary of the Project

Technology nowadays has made the life of ours much easier. And mobile technology is one of the optimum powered gadgets that has been created ever. And almost everything that we understand as mobile technology are application based. There are so many things like a communication device through messenger apps, accessories like calculators and calendars, transportation services like Uber have become a part of our daily lives. We are hoping that our this application will help people save their precious times and also will refrain them from taking the hassles of going to movie theaters early and stand in lines.
